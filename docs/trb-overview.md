# Troubleshooting
When the Agent for Windows or Unix generates errors and doesnâ€™t operate properly, you need to contact Tidal Support Center to help you resolve the technical issues. However, Tidal Support Center requires specific information on how the Agent is operating before they can track down the source of the problem. Before contacting Tidal Support Center about an agent issue, you should verify the agent version and turn on diagnostic logging to collect information about the way the agent is functioning. These are the first steps that Tidal Support Center will have you do, if you have not done it before contacting them.
