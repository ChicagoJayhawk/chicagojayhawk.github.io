# Deleting an agent connection

To delete an agent connection:

1. From the **Connections** panel, select the agent to delete.
1. Select the **Delete** button on the TA toolbar or press the **Delete** key on your keyboard.

    !!! note
        You cannot delete an agent connection unless you are connected to the TA Master. You can delete an agent connection that is currently in use; however, jobs that were to run on that agent will be disabled. Those jobs will not run again until you assign them to a valid new agent.
