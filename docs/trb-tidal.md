# Troubleshooting agent issues in Tidal Automation

This section provides information for troubleshooting agents in theTidal Automation client.

## Verifying the version of the agent
When consulting with Tidal Support Center about a problem with an agent, one of the most basic pieces of information they need is which version of the agent is being used.

To verify the version of the agent:

1. From the **Navigator** panel of the client, choose **Administration > Connections** to display the **Connections** panel.
2. In the various connections listed in the panel, locate the agent with the problem.
3. Look in the Version column of that agent to see the version of the agent being used.
