# Uninstalling Windows agents

To uninstall the agent, you must use the **Add/Remove Programs** utility in the Windows Control Panel.

To uninstall an agent:

1. Close the TA client.
2. From the Windows **Start** menu, choose **Settings > Control Panel**; then select **Add or Remove Programs**.
3. From the list of installed programs, select the **TA Agent** program.
4. Select **Remove** to start the uninstallation process.
5. When prompted to confirm that you want to uninstall the program, select **OK**. 
6. Select **Finish** to end the uninstallation process.
7. Reboot the machine to save the changes to the registry.

    **Note**: Occasionally, an empty folder might be left in the Start menu after uninstalling TA components. If this occurs, go to the **Programs** directory and manually delete the empty folder. The installation log file must also be manually deleted.
